        <h1>RetroButNew</h1>
        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>To bring back that code doesn't need to be that complicated, it just needs a good idea behind it, and this makes it incredibly lightweight, and we want to design it for older standards.</p>
        <pre>

        </pre>
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>We will create software to work with these old standards, we believe in retro operating systems meating open source.</p>
        <h2>What this means</h2>
        <p>This means anyone can get a head start with coding this, wether it's kid or a profesional, all you need is a computer and a good idea</p>
